# Metro-Mini
Final Project Term 2

```html
<center>Project Description</center>
A mimic of the original Mini Metro game, Metro Mini is a take on simulating public transportation through random spawn events, user-drawn pathways,<br> time constraints, and minimalistic graphic elements. Players are tasked with connecting neighboring stations and enabling passengers to travel from start to end

<center>Instructions</center>

Open and run "Game/Game.pde" in Processing.
Stations will spawn in random positions on the map. Connect the stations by dragging between them.
Passengers will appear at random stations with destinations in mind. Make sure the routes you draw enable them to reach their destinations.
Score, or the number of passengers who reach their station, is shown in upper right corner.
